# Seasonality
A Data-Driven Approach to Analysing Market Movement

Seasonality is a significant factor in financial markets. Asset prices typically follow specific trends over time—rising or falling during specific months, weeks, or even days. These historical trends can provide traders a significant advantage

By studying these recurring patterns, traders can match their strategies with the rhythm of the market and bring statistical support for trading decisions.  This approach doesn’t rely on predictions or news cycles—instead, it leans on years of price behaviour to identify when price tends to move.
